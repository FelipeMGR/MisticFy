# The Architecture

This application follows a modular standard, being the following:

  * ## Frontend
   Components that interacts with the user, making it a unique experience.


  * ## Backend
   Playlist management through the API, wich implements the SpotifyAPI.
   Data base to store sensitive user information (acess and authorization tokens, for example.)

# Next Steps

  * Implement the audio library onto the app
  * User interface
  * Implement the search by nmusic, artist and album (only for SpotifyID, for now)
